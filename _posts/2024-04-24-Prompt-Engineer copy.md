title: Intro to JavaScript aimed at Java programmers
---

[This is a talk I did a couple of years ago about JavaScript](https://youtu.be/FGNKoHv7xPY), for people from an OO background, explaining how to mentally translate common JavaScript features and patterns into the equivalent Java code.

I did it primarily because at that company there were many experienced Java coders who needed a quick start in JavaScript. If you're in the same boat you may find it useful!
