Motto: _Reparare in orbita_

"This process of constructing instruction tables should be very fascinating. There need be no real danger of it ever becoming a drudge, for any processes that are quite mechanical may be turned over to the machine itself."
-- **Alan M. Turing, 1946**

"The last thing one discovers in composing a work is what to put first."
-- **Blaise Pascal, c. 1660**

"He had bought a large map representing the sea,  
   Without the least vestige of land:  
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be  
   A map they could all understand."
-- **_The Hunting of the Snark_, Fit the Second**

"My stack runneth over..."
-- **Psalm 404**
